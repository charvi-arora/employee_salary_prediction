# Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview  
This project predicts employee salaries based on features like experience, education, and job role using machine learning regression models. It aims to help HR teams make fair, data-driven salary decisions.

## Features  
- Data preprocessing and encoding  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Training multiple regression models  
- Model evaluation and selection  
- Salary prediction for new employee profiles

## Implementation  
The project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Models trained include Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

## How to Run  
1. Install required packages:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
